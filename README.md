# Custom Input Contract Demo

A demo for redeeming custom input scripts with a Babbage action

## Getting Set Up

If you haven't already, you'll need to [download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and install it on your computer.

Then, download (or clone) this code from GitHub and put it into a folder on your computer where you will keep your coding projects.

To install the required packages and initialize this repository, open a Command Prompt or Terminal window. Change directories to where you've copied this code, then type:

```
npm install
```

Once this step is complete, your new Babbage app is ready to start. Go ahead and open up a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and load the project.

To start the app, just open another command window in the project folder and run:

```
npm run start
```

Once you see the page in your browser that says "Babbage React Starter", you are all up and running. Congrats!

Any changes you make to the code in your code editor should automatically update in your browser window. For bigger changes or if there are problems, just refresh the page.

If you ever lose your browser window and want to get it back, just make sure your start command is running (re-run it if not) and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

If you run into any problems getting set up, you can try searching Google for the error codes. If you're still stumped, come on over to [Atlantis](https://atlantis.planaria.network) and we'll help you out.
